Blooming Flower Animation

This project creates a simple animation of blooming flowers using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

Description
The animation generates multiple flowers with randomized petal counts, sizes, and colors. Each flower blooms at random positions on the canvas, creating a visually appealing effect.

How it Works
Canvas Setup: The HTML file contains a canvas element where the animation is rendered.
Drawing Flowers: The drawFlower() function is responsible for drawing individual flowers on the canvas. It takes parameters such as petal count, radius, and color to customize the appearance of each flower.
Blooming Animation: The bloom() function initiates the animation by repeatedly calling drawFlower() with random parameters. This creates the effect of flowers blooming across the canvas.
Randomization: The animation utilizes random values for petal count, radius, and color to ensure each flower appears unique.
Usage
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the blooming flower animation.

Compatibility
The animation is designed to work on modern web browsers that support HTML5 canvas.
